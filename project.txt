Project brief
...................................
In this project, you will work on developing REST API 
endpoints of various functionalities required for a 
Music Hoster App from scratch. In order to observe the 
functionality of the endpoints, you will use the Swagger 
user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. 
Also, the project has to be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).



4 Controllers
...................................
Signup Up 
Authntication
Music Upload
Admin


5 End Points
....................................
usersignup
auth/login
musicupload
music/id
music/upload/id


Controllers
.....................................
Signup-controller: In this controller, the user will able to sign up for an account.

Authentication-controller: After signing up, the user needs to sign in. 
This controller authenticates the user based on the credentials provided. 
After authentication, the user will be given an ‘access token’, 
which will be required to perform any further operation.

Music-upload-controller: Using the ‘access token’, 
the user can upload music files through this controller. 
But the music file is not ‘ACTIVE’ until reviewed by the admin.

Admin-controller: The admin needs to review all the music files uploaded by users. 
This controller provides the admin with the details about all the music files. 
Once the admin has reviewed the music file, he can update it (if needed) and 
make it ‘ACTIVE’ through this controller.


Controller
..........................................
The Controller is responsible for controlling the application logic and 
acts as the coordinator between the View and the Model. 
The Controller receives an input from the users via the View, 
then processes the user's data with the help of Model and passes the results back to the View.



Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) 
............................................
is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using 
an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are 
referring to a library that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, 
hence the phrase "an ORM".

An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice 
that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don't use SQL 
anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you're using.



@Service
..................................................
Service layer provides code modularity,the business logic and rules are specified in the service layer



A JSON Web Token (JWT) 
..................................................
is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained 
way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. 
JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.



DAO
....................................................
DAO stands for Data Access Object. DAO Design Pattern is used to 
separate the data persistence logic in a separate layer. This way, 
the service remains completely in dark about how the low-level operations 
to access the database is done. This is known as the principle of Separation of Logic.


@Entity
......................................................
The @Entity annotation specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
